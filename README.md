## 🛡️ Smart Contract Security Audit Reports
- [Smart Contract Audition of Cryptocurrency lending platform](https://github.com/shahin-zakizadeh/Audit-SmartContracts-CrytpoLending.git)
- [Ethernaut Challenges by OpenZeppelin](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/):
I successfully completed all the challenges in [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/), a gamified security learning platform developed by OpenZeppelin. The platform provides hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. Each challenge involved discovering, understanding, and exploiting real-world vulnerabilities, helping to deepen my expertise in smart contract security.

### Key Learnings:
- Exploited common Ethereum vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow, and delegatecall misuse.
- Gained hands-on experience with Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and low-level smart contract interactions.
- Enhanced my ability to secure smart contracts by identifying and mitigating security issues.

## 🌟 Selected Projects
### Cryptocurrency Lending Platform @ [MCLB](https://mclb.org/) (Freelancing)
Developed and audited smart contracts for a decentralized lending platform, ensuring security and scalability.

### Autonomous Trading Bot (Arbitrum Network)
Developed a trading bot leveraging flash loans and MEV strategies for cross-DEX and inner arbitrage on Arbitrum.

### Arbitrage 1inch Bot
Created an arbitrage bot using smart contracts on the 1inch exchange to capitalize on price discrepancies.
